**DevDocBot** acts as an intelligent layer over GitHub repositories. Instead of Ctrl+F keyword matching, it uses **Vector Embeddings** to understand the *meaning* of your query.

*Example: Searching for "how to scale" will find documents about "Horizontal Pod Autoscaler" even if the word "scale" isn't present.*

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a **Serverless Event-Driven Architecture** to ensure zero idle costs and infinite scalability.

### Key Components
1.  **Ingestion Pipeline:** GitHub Webhooks → API Gateway → SQS Queue → Indexer Lambda.
2.  **Search Pipeline:** API Gateway → Search Lambda → DynamoDB Cache → Vector Search.
3.  **AI/ML:** Hugging Face `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (via BAAI) for embeddings.
4.  **Database:** Pinecone (Vectors) + DynamoDB (Metadata & Caching).

*(See [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for detailed diagrams)*

## 🚀 Features

-   🔍 **Semantic Search:** Understands natural language queries.
-   ⚡ **Sub-100ms Latency:** Implements Read-Through Caching via DynamoDB.
-   🔄 **Auto-Sync:** Listens to GitHub `push` events to re-index documentation in real-time.
-   🛡️ **Resilience:** Uses Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) and SQS retries for fault tolerance.
-   📊 **Observability:** Custom CloudWatch Dashboard tracking Hit Rate, Latency, and Indexing Throughput.

## 🔌 API Usage

**Base URL:** `https://9xlucsfpd9.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/`

### 1. Search
```bash
curl -X POST /search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "deploy to kubernetes", "top_k": 3}'
```

### 2. Manual Document Upload
To index a local text file or manual content:

```bash
curl -X POST /documents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documents": [
      {
        "title": "K8s Pods Guide",
        "text": "A Pod is the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes.",
        "source": "manual",
        "url": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/"
      }
    ]
  }'
  
```

### 3. GitHub Auto-Indexing
The system listens for push events via Webhook. You can trigger it manually for testing:




```bash
curl -X POST /webhooks/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" \
  -d '{
    "repository": {
      "full_name": "ChinmayLokare/devdocbot-test-docs",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/ChinmayLokare/devdocbot-test-docs.git"
    },
    "ref": "refs/heads/main",
    "commits": [
      {
        "added": ["README.md"],
        "modified": []
      }
    ]
  }'
```


## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This project currently uses a hybrid deployment strategy:
1.  **Core Services:** Deployed via AWS Console for rapid prototyping.
2.  **IaC Demo:** A Terraform configuration is included in `/infra` to demonstrate how the stack would be provisioned in an enterprise environment.

**Terraform Plan:**
The `/infra` directory contains a modular Terraform setup including:
*   `providers.tf`: AWS Provider configuration.
*   `main.tf`: Resource definitions (DynamoDB example included).
*   `variables.tf`: Reusable configuration.

To run the IaC demo:
```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
